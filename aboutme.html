      <h2> SCHOOL. HOORAY! (partially sarcasm)* </h2>
        <p> Currently, I am a Bret Harte student, who before was a Williams student. Our school mascot is a Bronco, similar to a horse.I am in 6th grade, and I have wonderful teachers who are amazing and splendid. However, I have HOMEWORK, the best thing you can have in school (hooray ;). Down below is our school mascot, a bronco.

      <h2> Likes & Pet Peeves </h2>
      <h3> A: Likes: </h3>
      <p>   I like pokemon and gacha life. Also, I enjoy watching youtube. Some of my favorite youtubers are: Funneh (and the Krew), Sis vs Bro, Collins Key (and Devan Key), It's Crystal Snow, Jianhao Tan, Reacticorns, Wengie, and Gaming Therorists, etc. (please watch them, espically gaming therorist, because MatPat uses MATH AND SCIENCE to solve gaming theories, links are down below!). I also like to play Roblox, again links are down below! I love to draw Gacha life and scary things. I like editing photos and make them interesting. </p>

     <h3> B: Pet Peeves: </h3>
     <p>   Even though I like drawing scary things, I hate riddles and scary videos/movies. I hate my sister doing annoying stuff like sitting on my bed. I also hate it when I can't watch any recent pokemon movies because I am a huge fan of Pokemon. I hate it when my table partners don't follow the directions (probaly not trying to read it at all). (Vincent, seriously, just FOCUS and LOOK AT WHAT THE PROJECTER IS PROJECTING. I'm verrry annoyed.) </p>

      <h2> Github </h2>
      <p>  This is a website I used to make my very own website. I am in a class, where we use github, to create websites and the parts in them (like <html>, stylesheets.css, ect). Joining it is totally free! Also, this is not an ad for github, because it is a great website. </p>
      <h4 * I mean, not everyone enjoys school that much.:< Especially homework. That is the only thing I hate about school. </h4>
