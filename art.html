    WHY I LIKE POKEMON NO MATTER WHAT(well, think all you want)
     
    
    
    
    
    <p>  Ok, get this fact straight. I LIKE POKEMON AND I DON'T CARE WHAT EVER YOU SAY ABOUT POKEMON BEING STUPID!
    Many people say pokemon is stupid and childish but I don't think so. In fact, Pokemon is still very popular among adults (and a lot of Pokemon fans that are kids, like me.) Acorrding to some online surfing, Pokemon is one of the top most popular anime in 2019.And yes, Pokemon may be outdated, but what about all those Pokemon games that Nintendo pumps out like Let's Go Pikachu or Let's Go Eevee? Those are very popular games! Or what about Pokemon Go? Acoording to CNN Buisness, Pokemon Go is still one of the top trending games on mobile in the App Store. Plus, a lot of Pokemon are cute! </p>
